# TrainSchedule
https://kfroerer.github.io/TrainSchedule/

I rode trains almost every day when I lived in Germany and often had to run to make it in time. Train arrival boards were my lifeline, especially the minutes until the next train arrival!

The idea for this project was to develop an app which would use Firebase and moment.js to store, retrieve, and perform time calculations for trains entered through user input. 

As users add trains, first departure and frequency, moment.js is utilized to then calculate the time of the next train and also minutes until the next arrival.

For future development I would like to have trains ordered according to next arrival, just like the big Bahnhof signs in Germany.
